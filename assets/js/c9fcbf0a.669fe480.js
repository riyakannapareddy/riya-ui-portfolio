This leads to the word \u201cwhy\u201d and how this centers around this main issue Norman brings up. Root cause analysis is centered on the idea how determining what caused an error in someone\u2019s actions. This is where the word \u201cWhy\u201d comes into play as often when one wrong move is found the case is closed. This doesn\u2019t account for the possibility of a butterfly effect of multiple decisions causing the issue and also emphasize the human error component to drastically. This is where the \u201cFive Why\u2019s\u201d come into play. The 5 why\u2019s is a Japanese concept developed by Sakichi Toyoda for the Toyota Production System division of the Toyota Motor Company. When searching for this root cause, keep asking \u201cWhy\u201d and drill down as deep as possible to exhaust and flesh out the reason for a problematic behavior. The benefits and value of this method is the critical thinking facilitated in this process and pushing back against the tendency to stop finding potential errors once a human error is discovered. This has found mainstream use around a multitude of industries from business executives, UI designer, engineers and so much more."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>a});var n=o(6540);const s={},i=n.createContext(s);function r(e){const t=n.useContext(i);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),n.createElement(i.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
