I thought what better interface to experiment with than the color puzzle game\\n\\"I Love Hue\\"! I will first analyze and recreate the original palette of this interface and then spin up three different iterations of this interface with different harmonic color\\ncombinations. \\n\\n##Original Interface\\n![ilovehue original interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-og.png)\\n\\n##Recreation of Interface\\n![ilovehue recreated interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-recreation.png)\\n\\nThe original color scheme of the I love hue interface fits into the triad harmony, these \\nbeing the primary colors of yellow, red, and blue. This color scheme exemplifies simplicity and harmony. I think this was a very intelligent choice from the designers as primary colors\\nare the foundation of the game which tests users eye for colors and how each hue fits together.  As this is a relaxing low stakes puzzle game I think these muted colors work very well to not excite the mind too much and allow the player to relax and focus on the colors of the puzzle to solve.\\n\\n##Achromatic Interface\\n![ilovehue achromatic interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-achromatic.png)\\nThe first color scheme I tried my hand at was an achromatic color scheme using \\nblack and white and all the shades in between those colors. This was my favorite new\\niteration by far. It stays true to the values of simplicity and ease on the mind.This sleek,\\nsimple palette allows for the colors of the puzzle to truly shine and be the main focus of\\nthe game. This also thematically fits well into the game similar to their primary triad\\nharmony.\\n\\n##Anagolous Interface\\n![ilovehue anagolous interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-anagolous.png)\\nThe next color harmony I tried was an analogous color palette. I used blue, blue green and \\nblue violet. I choose to use a blue analogous palette as blue evokes feeling of peace and \\nrelaxation which fits the purpose of the game. I think this palette is very soothing to the \\neye and mind, however it has more potential to clash based on the colors of the puzzle. I think the fact certain color puzzles will stand out and pop far more than others is a detriment to this design.\\n\\n##Square Interface\\n![ilovehue square interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-square.png)\\nThe last color harmony I tried out is a square color harmony. I used red, green, purple\\nand yellow. I wasn\'t the biggest fan of this palette as it gave it a more childish, chaotic\\nlook compared to the other choices. I think this would also clash with the palettes of\\nthe puzzles potentially. I think this gives the energy of a more fast paced, energetic game\\nrather than the slow, meticilous process i love hue creates.\\n\\n##Final Thoughts\\nOverall I think the original color scheme was the most effective for this game. It\\nwas very purposeful and truly lives up to the name of the game by incorporating\\nall the primary colors. The point of the game is to get lost in the world of color\\nand relax and the triad harmony is a wonderful vessel to present this. The achromatic\\npalette is a close second due to the reasons I love the original palette so much. \\nIt doesn\'t distract from the puzzle which is the central focus and creates a feeling\\nof peace and calmness."},{"id":"/colors-2-blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2-blog","source":"@site/blog/colors2blog.md","title":"Colors 2","description":"Standardization","date":"2024-09-27T14:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"readingTime":0.765,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Colors 2","slug":"/colors-2-blog","date":"2024-09-27T14:30:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Color Harmony Excercise","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/color-harmony-excercise"},"nextItem":{"title":"Aesthetic Design","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/aesthetic-design-post"}},"content":"Standardization\\n\\nStandardization is at the crux of this weeks reading.

The rule of thirds is derived from another concept called \\"the golden ratio\\", which means we are drawn to images that have proportions following the golden ratio which for rectangles has the proportions of 1:1.618. The rule of thirds acts is a technique that all starts with superimposing a 3x3 grid onto the piece in question. The corners of the middle square are the \\"power points\\" which are the ideal areas to place your power points. This is a personal tangent but I thought for the longest time the rule of thirds meant that when you are adding the same design elements it is best to do it in groups of three for the most balance. My mom taught me this when she would create bouquets and it is a principle I always think about when creating artwork. I am curious if this abstraction of the official rule of thirds rule has any basis because it always felt like something that elevated my designs. Now I will paste some art pieces I have created and see how well they follow the rule of thirds.\\n\\n![Aesthetic Design Analysis](../docs/assets/aesthetic-design-analysis.jpg)"},{"id":"/example-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/example-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/exampleblogpost.md","title":"Example Blog Post","description":"","date":"2024-08-26T14:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"readingTime":0,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Example Blog Post","slug":"/example-blog-post","date":"2024-08-26T14:30:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Aesthetic Design","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/aesthetic-design-post"}},"content":""}]}}')}}]);
