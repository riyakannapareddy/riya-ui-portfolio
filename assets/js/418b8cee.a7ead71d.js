Some words of advice outlined in the book\nis really sitting by yourself to reach that ideal big picture. It is important to have a clear, undistracted\nmind to reach this state where problems and goals that may hinder this process appear. Another\nkey piece of advice is going "analog" and relying on pens, whiteboards, and papers for rough ideation\nto further build the main idea of the design. This immediatly reminded me of the process of zooming\nin when taking a picture using a camera. From the visual experience being the photographer to the actual\nmechanics the camera goes too. At first you see the entire landscape of opporutnities but with the help\nof guided direction and focus you can hone in on the subject and key component of the image with the help\nof the lens. I see the lens as a blinder of other distractions like the advice mentioned above of being alone\nand going analog. Only with giving up some focus and detail of the many other components, can one truly focus in\nand capture that main idea.'})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,o.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(p,{...e})}):p(e)}},8453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>r,x:()=>s});var o=t(6540);const i={},a=o.createContext(i);function r(e){const n=o.useContext(a);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),o.createElement(a.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
