One of the most beautiful ways the psychology of color manifests is through film and television. This also is a very intuitive way to understand color theory and the impact of color as our brain subconsciously reacts to the creators choices. One of the best ways in our generation this was demonstrated was in the HBO series Euphoria. Each character has very deliberate colors that make up their wardrobe and this even changes as characters develop and transition. Maddie is a strong, independent, hard to read and confident character which is perfectly exemplified through her palette of rich purples. As purple is the color of royalty is also reflects her desire for upward social mobility. Cassie is often adorned in baby blues which mirror her highly sensitive, emotional personality. It also reflects her character traits of being a people pleaser and impulsive and to be on the nose the sadness and grief that surrounds her character. Kat's whole character arc is about developing confidence in herself and her body as a plus size women. This is beautifully demonstrated as she starts wearing the bold, dominating, and eye catching colors of red and black."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:o}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return o?(0,r.jsx)(o,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8453:(e,o,t)=>{t.d(o,{R:()=>i,x:()=>a});var r=t(6540);const s={},n=r.createContext(s);function i(e){const o=r.useContext(n);return r.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(o):{...o,...e}}),[o,e])}function a(e){let o;return o=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:i(e.components),r.createElement(n.Provider,{value:o},e.children)}}}]);
