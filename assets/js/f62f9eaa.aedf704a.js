Just as users of interfaces don't want to overthink things, so do designers working together on a team to create a product! This is why standardization is key which manifests in tools like style guides and content strategy. Content strategy focuses on edge cases which style guides may not cover. This includes features like which capitalization structure to use, a set standard of vocabulary for actions with many possible word choices, and localization for different languages and cultural conventions. Style guides are similar to documentation for software. They are an extensive packet of guidelines and components used in an interface. Everyone has that experience watching a phenomenal presentation but the legitimacy is brought down as it is clear different people worked on a different sections of the slide deck. Style guides circumvent this issue by working to achieve visual consistency and representative branding."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var i=n(6540);const s={},o=i.createContext(s);function a(e){const t=i.useContext(o);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:a(e.components),i.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
