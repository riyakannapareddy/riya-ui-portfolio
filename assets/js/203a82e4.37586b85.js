I decided to tackle this task alone as I had more than enough inspiration and excitement towards an application idea which has been at the back of my mind for some time.\\n\\nI primarily attribute two preexisting creations to my project vision. The first was a personal styling app called \u201cStylebook\u201d. In the midst of the pandemic with nowhere to go but all the time on my hands, I decided to kill two birds with one stone: first filter and trim down on the massive amount of clothes I had acclimated over the years and second to catalogue and play around with different outfits and style aesthetics using my clothing to create options to save myself time and explore my creativity and style. However, after the massive initial time sink of using this app which took hours of photographing, editing, and documenting all my clothes I found the actual process they had for putting together outfits underwhelming. There were too many unaccounted variables and a quite draining and uninspiring app design that didn\u2019t succeed in capturing my gaze. However, this planted the necessary seeds for my design I will be presenting today. Several years later but coincidentally aligning with the period I embarked on this project; I got into the hit Roblox game \u201cDress to Impress\u201d. This game reignited my love for the creativity and confidence that blooms through finding your personal style and most important the wealth of options at my fingertips with the fixed amount of clothing I already own. Combining the novelty and creativity of Dress to Impress with the functionality of Stylebook I was able to find the values which guided my love for these concepts which is creativity and sustainability.  These values then directed how I would create my own design to go above and beyond the benefits these inspirations offered.\\n\\nWith my inspiration, values, and initial concept fresh in my mind I continued to ideate on what this application and design would manifest as. Individually, I had a large stake in this design as I fell into the target audience, however if I wanted to create an accessible and meaningful user facing design I would have to reach out and get many perspectives other than my own. So, I conducted several user interviews and from there shaped a user persona and story for my personal style app! Through my user interviews I was able to deduce some audience pain points and needs which would guide my design. Some important considerations were the impact of trying on clothes in a physical versus digital space, the cost and waste of purchasing new clothing items, wanting to maximize items a person already owns, and wanting to feel confident and assured in the outfits they decide to wear. From this I formed the narrative our user persona \u201cApril\u201d a college girl strapped for cash but wanting to explore her unique taste and interest in renaissance era styles while cutting back on her fast fashion spending and her mental block of wanting to fit in but not feeling as confident in the standard fashion seen at her university.\\n\\nBy preparing through interviewing and creating a narrative I had the right direction to create my low fidelity sketches of my application. One of the most important components of my application I quickly narrowed down was that it would be a mobile application. This app is meant to save time and create a feeling of comfort that allows individuals to express their creativity. Mobile devices are optimal as they have that built in ease of access and familiarity. I also fleshed out the core functionality which would be a closet, wish list, inspiration, and clothing studio pages.\\n\\n![initial app sketch](../docs/assets/sketch.png)\\n\\nWith my initial sketch outlined I now had the confidence to continue creating my design system! At this point the opportunities were endless on what to tackle first for my design. I have always been someone who prioritized having all my ingredients measured out and in hand before I begin the \u201crecipe\u201d, so I first began by playing around and finalizing my favorite color schemes, typography and overall design aesthetic. Pinterest was a huge help and guiding force in this area and I found myself falling in love with the \u201cbrutalist\u201d UI design style which I found ironic considering my hatred for brutalist architecture. Knowing I was taking a brutalist direction I prioritized modern, bold and blocky fonts, desaturated neutral colors, thin and sharp lines and corners, and lots of white space and overall simplicity.\\n\\n![design system](../docs/assets/design_sys.png)\\n\\nOnce I had these foundational aspects alongside shared components between pages I decided to start with the \u201cStudio\u201d page which was the most exciting problem to tackle personally and the section of my application which would create the most value based on my narrative. There were many challenges along the way as I was balancing an information and choice heavy application with a modern and sleek design, especially on the studio page which combines every other page into one interface. I thought my initial sketch would be sufficient to dive straight into designing, but I found myself delving deeper and deeper into the nuances of each page and possible action. I often kept reiterating on these low fidelity sketches to clear up any questions before and as I worked in Figma.\\n\\n![studio sketching](../docs/assets/studio_sketch.jpg)\\n\\nInitial Prototype\\n<iframe style={{border: \\"1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)\\"}} width=\\"800\\" height=\\"450\\" src=\\"https://embed.figma.com/design/UK9uUpAhDIBDZ92RVxjQA3/Final-Project-Design-System?node-id=0-1&embed-host=share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\nAfter many long nights and hours spent on finalizing the prototype, it was time to take it to the chopping block: conducting user tests. I conducted user tests with a colleague from my class and an external person that fit my target audience. I placed the design in front of them and did a more unstructured test with my colleague and a more structured test for the specific user I chose. The first test had quite vague directions and mostly aimed to see people\'s first impressions and intuition when faced with my design. The structured test had more specific instructions which really put the functionality of my application to the test. This was a super constructive and insightful experience which gave me lots of important insights on things that I had slightly thought about or had completely skipped my mind as I was so used to the design I had been working on. I was really pleased that my users were impressed by the aesthetics, vibe, and diversity of my application. These were things I had the most fun working on and probably put the most time into, so I was happy that hard work paid off. Most of the usability concerns regarded understanding things that were associated and presented in front of them. The consensus was that the structure and design were solid but there were small tweaks and areas that could be modified for more ease of use and understanding of affordances.\\n\\nI will now delve into the specific usability concerns I decided to tackle as they were of the highest priority and a sentiment echoed across my user tests.\\n\\n1. **Save button in studio**  \\n  The lack of clarity behind the icon I chose was a usability issue I encountered time and time again with the save outfit functionality in the studio page. As this is the crux of the creativity and purpose of the app with users creating and cataloging their preferred items, it was vital for me to make this clearer. I noticed that there were several icons available that could indicate wanting to save something and while I thought the one I chose was sufficient, my colleagues said it looked more like an upload button. I went for a slightly embellished but overall very simple check mark to indicate where to save your outfit and relinked all the necessary interactions.\\n\\n2. **Pictures and Text associations**  \\n  This was another usability issue which slipped my mind as I was working and seeing the same thing repeatedly but something that popped up with the fresh set of eyes my colleagues gave me. This was a hard one for me to implement as I was very satisfied with the design of my home page and thought the arrows and text were sufficient to indicate what goes together. I didn\u2019t want to sacrifice the geometric lines I had put throughout the whole main page as I thought that was a huge part of the aesthetic appeal. However, I took the leap and got rid of the lines and ended up liking this design a lot more with the bonus of better readability!\\n\\n3. **Studio Clothing Collapsible menu**  \\n  I knew this was bound to show up in my user testing as I had been struggling to implement it in Figma and put it on the back burner due to my issues in implementing an expandable and collapsible sidebar menu for all the clothing in their respective sections. This adds so much to the design as users can scroll through and see the potential of this feature rather than having a fixed menu only showing skirts. After trial and error with creating components and auto layout, I was able to accomplish this advanced functionality in Figma and have it fit in perfectly with the overall Studio page.\\n\\n4. **Text on Home Page**  \\n  I got lots of feedback on the readability of the home page and there were several directions I could go. I decided to add blurbs for each section to immediately key in users on what each section is intended to do and the overall narrative for the purpose of the application.\\n\\n5. **Clickable Areas**  \\n  This was another recurring concern I received especially as this is a mobile application. Rather than completely redesigning and reworking my interactions, I instead gave users more options and freedoms for clickable areas and different gestures so they can\u2019t really mess up and the flow of the application wasn\u2019t compromised.\\n\\nUser Testing Changes\\n<iframe style={{border: \\"1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\\"}} width=\\"800\\" height=\\"450\\" src=\\"https://embed.figma.com/design/vMADeAuVf2QUHi2hdHYOT4/Final-Project-Design-System-(Copy)-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&embed-host=share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":"/inclusive-design-constraints","metadata":{"permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-constraints","source":"@site/blog/constraintsinclusivedesignblog.md","title":"Inclusive Design Constraints","description":"Constraints Concept Map","date":"2024-10-31T14:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"ConceptMap","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/conceptmap","description":"Represent a set of concepts from the reading in a concept map and describe the relationships."}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Inclusive Design Constraints","slug":"/inclusive-design-constraints","date":"2024-10-31T14:30:00.000Z","tags":["conceptmap"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Design Evolution Narrative Draft","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/design_evolution_narrative_draft"},"nextItem":{"title":"Inclusive Design","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-blog"}},"content":"Constraints Concept Map\\n![constraints concept map](../docs/assets/constraints.jpg)\\n\\nI decided to map out the four types of constraints detailed in chapter 4 of\\n\\"The Design of Everday Things\\".

Root cause analysis is centered on the idea how determining what caused an error in someone\u2019s actions. This is where the word \u201cWhy\u201d comes into play as often when one wrong move is found the case is closed. This doesn\u2019t account for the possibility of a butterfly effect of multiple decisions causing the issue and also emphasize the human error component to drastically. This is where the \u201cFive Why\u2019s\u201d come into play. The 5 why\u2019s is a Japanese concept developed by Sakichi Toyoda for the Toyota Production System division of the Toyota Motor Company. When searching for this root cause, keep asking \u201cWhy\u201d and drill down as deep as possible to exhaust and flesh out the reason for a problematic behavior. The benefits and value of this method is the critical thinking facilitated in this process and pushing back against the tendency to stop finding potential errors once a human error is discovered.

After some time I still find the piece \u201cPassion Flowers and Hummingbirds\u201d by the American artist Martin Johnson Heade to be the most compelling. The creation of this painting spanned from 1870-1883. One of the most fascinating parts regarding the history of this piece is how Heade was inspired by the revolutionary knowledge of Charles Darwin\u2019s studies on evolution. He already had a fascination with hummingbirds since childhood and this was further exacerbated by Darwins example of hummingbird beak adaption for the purpose of fertilizing hummingbirds. During his trip to Central America he painted the interrelationship between flora and fauna he saw in Panama while also integrating spiritual elements of Christianity through nuances within the form of his paintings. \\n\\nArt Analysis\\n\\nSaturation\\nhttps://drawpaintacademy.com/color-saturation/\\n\\nHeade masterfully uses saturation guide the viewers eye to the most important parts of the painting and set the mood. The passionflower are the intended focus of this painting and Heade drives this point home using a vibrant, highly saturated shade of red. The color context is important with this choice as the passionflowers are the most saturated hue present in this painting. If the vines and leaves adorning the flowers were the same level of saturation the pop the passionflowers give would get washed out and thus have less impact Atmospheric perspective is another component of this painting which means as an object recedes, it mirrors its surrounding appearance more. One component of this means that as an object is more in the background it tends to be less saturated and more dull which is clearly seen in the brush and fog in this painting. This is also a component of depth which will be discussed in the next section! \\n\\nDepth\\nhttps://www.bbcmaestro.com/blog/creating-depth-in-art\\n\\nCreating depth in an artwork is achieved through choices that leverage the facets of color and how the human eye works. Despite this being a flat canvas the painting looks to be a snapshot of a bundle of flowers lost in an imposing, foggy jungle that goes as far as the eye can see. As previously mentioned atmospheric depth is one way to do this as objects in the background will be far more dull and desaturated. Another way this illusion of depth is refined is through detail and focus. This is best seen through how Heade painted the jungle brush. The brush that is seen at the bottom of the canvas has clear individual leaves where light hits the tops of them and underneath eacb leaf is shrouded in shadow. Going to the brush slightly above that, the shadows become more blurry and muted and the colors blend together more creating a lower resolution look which corresponds to being further away. These are all further driven home through value which will be discussed in the final section of contrast!\\n\\n\\nContrast \\nhttps://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-contrast-in-art-definition/\\n\\nThe final component that brings together this painting is contrast! Contrast is a fascinating feature of art due to manifesting in several different ways. The primary way is through complementary colors which are opposite colors on the color wheel. This is present in the painting through the vibrant red flowers and the muted green foliage. The next way is the contrast between dark and light or value. The passionflower closest to the hummingbirds has the brightest red colors even among the other flowers which indicates it is the first thing Heade wanted the viewer to look at. Not only does he use saturation to differentiate different elements in the painting, but the same objects as well. There is an also contrast present between the bright fog and the dark foliage. Lastly the size of the elements create contrast which is seen through the large, highly detailed flowers in the foreground and the much smaller foliage as the painting gets further away. These all work together to create depth and visual interest. \\n\\n#You should take a photo or scan of your sketch and add it to your blog post. Then, describe your UI.

I thought what better interface to experiment with than the color puzzle game\\n\\"I Love Hue\\"! I will first analyze and recreate the original palette of this interface and then spin up three different iterations of this interface with different harmonic color\\ncombinations. \\n\\n##Original Interface\\n![ilovehue original interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-og.png)\\n\\n##Recreation of Interface\\n![ilovehue recreated interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-recreation.png)\\n\\nThe original color scheme of the I love hue interface fits into the triad harmony, these \\nbeing the primary colors of yellow, red, and blue. This color scheme exemplifies simplicity and harmony. I think this was a very intelligent choice from the designers as primary colors\\nare the foundation of the game which tests users eye for colors and how each hue fits together.  As this is a relaxing low stakes puzzle game I think these muted colors work very well to not excite the mind too much and allow the player to relax and focus on the colors of the puzzle to solve.\\n\\n##Achromatic Interface\\n![ilovehue achromatic interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-achromatic.png)\\nThe first color scheme I tried my hand at was an achromatic color scheme using \\nblack and white and all the shades in between those colors. This was my favorite new\\niteration by far. It stays true to the values of simplicity and ease on the mind.This sleek,\\nsimple palette allows for the colors of the puzzle to truly shine and be the main focus of\\nthe game. This also thematically fits well into the game similar to their primary triad\\nharmony.\\n\\n##Anagolous Interface\\n![ilovehue anagolous interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-anagolous.png)\\nThe next color harmony I tried was an analogous color palette. I used blue, blue green and \\nblue violet. I choose to use a blue analogous palette as blue evokes feeling of peace and \\nrelaxation which fits the purpose of the game. I think this palette is very soothing to the \\neye and mind, however it has more potential to clash based on the colors of the puzzle. I think the fact certain color puzzles will stand out and pop far more than others is a detriment to this design.\\n\\n##Square Interface\\n![ilovehue square interface](../docs/assets/ilovehue-square.png)\\nThe last color harmony I tried out is a square color harmony. I used red, green, purple\\nand yellow. I wasn\'t the biggest fan of this palette as it gave it a more childish, chaotic\\nlook compared to the other choices. I think this would also clash with the palettes of\\nthe puzzles potentially. I think this gives the energy of a more fast paced, energetic game\\nrather than the slow, meticilous process i love hue creates.\\n\\n##Final Thoughts\\nOverall I think the original color scheme was the most effective for this game. It\\nwas very purposeful and truly lives up to the name of the game by incorporating\\nall the primary colors. The point of the game is to get lost in the world of color\\nand relax and the triad harmony is a wonderful vessel to present this. The achromatic\\npalette is a close second due to the reasons I love the original palette so much. \\nIt doesn\'t distract from the puzzle which is the central focus and creates a feeling\\nof peace and calmness."},{"id":"/colors-2-blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2-blog","source":"@site/blog/colors2blog.md","title":"Colors 2","description":"Psychology of Color Through Television","date":"2024-09-27T14:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Colors 2","slug":"/colors-2-blog","date":"2024-09-27T14:30:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Color Harmony Excercise","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/color-harmony-excercise"},"nextItem":{"title":"Aesthetic Design","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/aesthetic-design-post"}},"content":"Psychology of Color Through Television\\n\\nThese sections dive into the psychology of color from the feelings each hue in the rainbow invoke to the lucrative market of understanding color trends for different customer segments. One of the most beautiful ways the psychology of color manifests is through film and television. This also is a very intuitive way to understand color theory and the impact of color as our brain subconsciously reacts to the creators choices. One of the best ways in our generation this was demonstrated was in the HBO series Euphoria. Each character has very deliberate colors that make up their wardrobe and this even changes as characters develop and transition. Maddie is a strong, independent, hard to read and confident character which is perfectly exemplified through her palette of rich purples. As purple is the color of royalty is also reflects her desire for upward social mobility. Cassie is often adorned in baby blues which mirror her highly sensitive, emotional personality. It also reflects her character traits of being a people pleaser and impulsive and to be on the nose the sadness and grief that surrounds her character. Kat\'s whole character arc is about developing confidence in herself and her body as a plus size women. This is beautifully demonstrated as she starts wearing the bold, dominating, and eye catching colors of red and black."},{"id":"/aesthetic-design-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/aesthetic-design-post","source":"@site/blog/aestheticdesignblog.md","title":"Aesthetic Design","description":"Art Analysis- Rule of Thirds","date":"2024-09-20T14:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FreeForm","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform","description":"Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources."}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Aesthetic Design","slug":"/aesthetic-design-post","date":"2024-09-20T14:30:00.000Z","tags":["freeform"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Colors 2","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/colors-2-blog"},"nextItem":{"title":"example-blog-post","permalink":"/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/example-blog-post"}},"content":"Art Analysis- Rule of Thirds\\n\\nThe rule of thirds was a very important section of this reading . The rule of thirds is derived from another concept called \\"the golden ratio\\", which means we are drawn to images that have proportions following the golden ratio which for rectangles has the proportions of 1:1.618. The rule of thirds acts is a technique that all starts with superimposing a 3x3 grid onto the piece in question. The corners of the middle square are the \\"power points\\" which are the ideal areas to place your power points. This is a personal tangent but I thought for the longest time the rule of thirds meant that when you are adding the same design elements it is best to do it in groups of three for the most balance. My mom taught me this when she would create bouquets and it is a principle I always think about when creating artwork. I am curious if this abstraction of the official rule of thirds rule has any basis because it always felt like something that elevated my designs.
