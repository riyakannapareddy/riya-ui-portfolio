User Testing 101

"WHY"

In chapter 5 of “Design of Everyday Things” Norman hones in on the devastation that poor design can create and as a result why it is key to be able to diagnose these problems before and as they come about. This leads to the word “why” and how this centers around this main issue Norman brings up. Root cause analysis is centered on the idea how determining what caused an error in someone’s actions. This is where the word “Why” comes into play as often when one wrong move is found the case is closed. This doesn’t account for the possibility of a butterfly effect of multiple decisions causing the issue and also emphasize the human error component to drastically. This is where the “Five Why’s” come into play. The 5 why’s is a Japanese concept developed by Sakichi Toyoda for the Toyota Production System division of the Toyota Motor Company. When searching for this root cause, keep asking “Why” and drill down as deep as possible to exhaust and flesh out the reason for a problematic behavior. The benefits and value of this method is the critical thinking facilitated in this process and pushing back against the tendency to stop finding potential errors once a human error is discovered. This has found mainstream use around a multitude of industries from business executives, UI designer, engineers and so much more.
