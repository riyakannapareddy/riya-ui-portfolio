Inclusive Design Accessibility

"Accessibility is to UI/UX design as a ramp is to a sidewalk"

One of the core arguments supporting the need for accesibility is that while it isn't just
the moral thing to do, it also benefits and uplifts all users of the web. Innovations like
closed captioning, larger text, readable and digestible pages, easy accesss to the main
content of a webpage, etc. all serve to empower the user experience on the web. While they are
primarily tabled with individuals from a range of disabilities, many people can benefit
and use these options without a thought to make their web surfing more smooth. This ties into the
analogy, as a lot of things we observe in our day to day that aim to help people with disabilities
also create ease in the places they're implemented in. A sidewalk ramp is vital to those in wheelchairs
and also serves as a net positive for those riding in a bike, parents with strollers, and even just those
feeling a little tired after a long walk!
