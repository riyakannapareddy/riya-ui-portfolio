Big Picture in Planning

"Seeing the big picture when creating mockups is to focusing the lens on a camera"

Chapter 2 of Presentation Zen hones in on the importance of drilling down to the big
picture of your design when in the planning stage. Some words of advice outlined in the book 
is really sitting by yourself to reach that ideal big picture. It is important to have a clear, undistracted
mind to reach this state where problems and goals that may hinder this process appear. Another
key piece of advice is going "analog" and relying on pens, whiteboards, and papers for rough ideation
to further build the main idea of the design. This immediatly reminded me of the process of zooming 
in when taking a picture using a camera. From the visual experience being the photographer to the actual
mechanics the camera goes too. At first you see the entire landscape of opporutnities but with the help
of guided direction and focus you can hone in on the subject and key component of the image with the help
of the lens. I see the lens as a blinder of other distractions like the advice mentioned above of being alone
and going analog. Only with giving up some focus and detail of the many other components, can one truly focus in
and capture that main idea.
