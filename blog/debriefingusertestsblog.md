Do It Yourself Testing

In today's blog entry I will be capturing the most important pieces in Chapter 9
of Steven Krug's book revered design book "Don't Make Me Think". This chapter
expands on the key component of the desing life cycle: user testing. However Krug offers
a novel, cheaper, and more efficient approach to this practice through "Do It Yourself
Testing". 

1. Time Spent For Each Round of Testing

One morning per month, this factors in conducting the tests, debriefing, and narrowing 
down what fixes to tackle. 

2. When do you test

Throughout the development process rather than when the project is almost done.

3. Number of testing rounds

One per month is all that is nessecary as it it becomes a monthly routine!

4. Number of participants

3 is more than enough to capture the most vital details

5. How do you choose particpants

It is okay to not have the most segmented population to test. The frequency matters
more than the testers profile. It also is good to have prodcts as accessible as possible.

6. Where do you test

On site or remote with observers in a seperate room using screen sharing to analyze.

7. Who should watch

On site testing allows a wife variety of people working on the project to observe as well
as making it half a day only.

8. Reporting

1-2 page email is enough to capture the team's decisions during debriefing. 

9. Who identifies issues?

The development team should contribute to this role as well as key stakeholders who
ideally could meet over lunch to compare and contrast observations. 

10. Primary Purpose

Identify most common and fatal issues and commit to cleaning those up by the next
month for scheduled testing. 

11. Costs

A couple hundred dollars or less per round of testing!
