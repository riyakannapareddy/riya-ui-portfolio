fulfilling semester long journey towards my finalized UI/UX design for my own original mobile application! I decided to tackle this task alone as I had more than enough inspiration and excitement towards an application idea which has been at the back of my mind for some time.</p>
<p>I primarily attribute two preexisting creations to my project vision. The first was a personal styling app called “Stylebook”. In the midst of the pandemic with nowhere to go but all the time on my hands, I decided to kill two birds with one stone: first filter and trim down on the massive amount of clothes I had acclimated over the years and second to catalogue and play around with different outfits and style aesthetics using my clothing to create options to save myself time and explore my creativity and style. However, after the massive initial time sink of using this app which took hours of photographing, editing, and documenting all my clothes I found the actual process they had for putting together outfits underwhelming. There were too many unaccounted variables and a quite draining and uninspiring app design that didn’t succeed in capturing my gaze. However, this planted the necessary seeds for my design I will be presenting today. Several years later but coincidentally aligning with the period I embarked on this project; I got into the hit Roblox game “Dress to Impress”. This game reignited my love for the creativity and confidence that blooms through finding your personal style and most important the wealth of options at my fingertips with the fixed amount of clothing I already own. Combining the novelty and creativity of Dress to Impress with the functionality of Stylebook I was able to find the values which guided my love for these concepts which is creativity and sustainability.  These values then directed how I would create my own design to go above and beyond the benefits these inspirations offered.</p>
<p>With my inspiration, values, and initial concept fresh in my mind I continued to ideate on what this application and design would manifest as. Individually, I had a large stake in this design as I fell into the target audience, however if I wanted to create an accessible and meaningful user facing design I would have to reach out and get many perspectives other than my own. So, I conducted several user interviews and from there shaped a user persona and story for my personal style app! Through my user interviews I was able to deduce some audience pain points and needs which would guide my design. Some important considerations were the impact of trying on clothes in a physical versus digital space, the cost and waste of purchasing new clothing items, wanting to maximize items a person already owns, and wanting to feel confident and assured in the outfits they decide to wear. From this I formed the narrative our user persona “April” a college girl strapped for cash but wanting to explore her unique taste and interest in renaissance era styles while cutting back on her fast fashion spending and her mental block of wanting to fit in but not feeling as confident in the standard fashion seen at her university.</p>
<p>By preparing through interviewing and creating a narrative I had the right direction to create my low fidelity sketches of my application. One of the most important components of my application I quickly narrowed down was that it would be a mobile application. This app is meant to save time and create a feeling of comfort that allows individuals to express their creativity. Mobile devices are optimal as they have that built in ease of access and familiarity. I also fleshed out the core functionality which would be a closet, wish list, inspiration, and clothing studio pages.</p>

<p>With my initial sketch outlined I now had the confidence to continue creating my design system! At this point the opportunities were endless on what to tackle first for my design. I have always been someone who prioritized having all my ingredients measured out and in hand before I begin the “recipe”, so I first began by playing around and finalizing my favorite color schemes, typography and overall design aesthetic. Pinterest was a huge help and guiding force in this area and I found myself falling in love with the “brutalist” UI design style which I found ironic considering my hatred for brutalist architecture. Knowing I was taking a brutalist direction I prioritized modern, bold and blocky fonts, desaturated neutral colors, thin and sharp lines and corners, and lots of white space and overall simplicity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="design system" src="/riya-ui-portfolio/assets/images/design_sys-55303aee401767885f6f56860563ca8b.png" width="612" height="478" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Once I had these foundational aspects alongside shared components between pages I decided to start with the “Studio” page which was the most exciting problem to tackle personally and the section of my application which would create the most value based on my narrative. There were many challenges along the way as I was balancing an information and choice heavy application with a modern and sleek design, especially on the studio page which combines every other page into one interface. I thought my initial sketch would be sufficient to dive straight into designing, but I found myself delving deeper and deeper into the nuances of each page and possible action. I often kept reiterating on these low fidelity sketches to clear up any questions before and as I worked in Figma.</p>

<p>Initial Prototype</p>
<iframe style="border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/UK9uUpAhDIBDZ92RVxjQA3/Final-Project-Design-System?node-id=0-1&amp;embed-host=share"></iframe>
<p>After many long nights and hours spent on finalizing the prototype, it was time to take it to the chopping block: conducting user tests. I conducted user tests with a colleague from my class and an external person that fit my target audience. I placed the design in front of them and did a more unstructured test with my colleague and a more structured test for the specific user I chose. The first test had quite vague directions and mostly aimed to see people&#x27;s first impressions and intuition when faced with my design. The structured test had more specific instructions which really put the functionality of my application to the test. This was a super constructive and insightful experience which gave me lots of important insights on things that I had slightly thought about or had completely skipped my mind as I was so used to the design I had been working on. I was really pleased that my users were impressed by the aesthetics, vibe, and diversity of my application. These were things I had the most fun working on and probably put the most time into, so I was happy that hard work paid off. Most of the usability concerns regarded understanding things that were associated and presented in front of them. The consensus was that the structure and design were solid but there were small tweaks and areas that could be modified for more ease of use and understanding of affordances.</p>
<p>I will now delve into the specific usability concerns I decided to tackle as they were of the highest priority and a sentiment echoed across my user tests.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Save button in studio</strong><br>
<!-- -->The lack of clarity behind the icon I chose was a usability issue I encountered time and time again with the save outfit functionality in the studio page. As this is the crux of the creativity and purpose of the app with users creating and cataloging their preferred items, it was vital for me to make this clearer. I noticed that there were several icons available that could indicate wanting to save something and while I thought the one I chose was sufficient, my colleagues said it looked more like an upload button. I went for a slightly embellished but overall very simple check mark to indicate where to save your outfit and relinked all the necessary interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pictures and Text associations</strong><br>
<!-- -->This was another usability issue which slipped my mind as I was working and seeing the same thing repeatedly but something that popped up with the fresh set of eyes my colleagues gave me. This was a hard one for me to implement as I was very satisfied with the design of my home page and thought the arrows and text were sufficient to indicate what goes together. I didn’t want to sacrifice the geometric lines I had put throughout the whole main page as I thought that was a huge part of the aesthetic appeal. However, I took the leap and got rid of the lines and ended up liking this design a lot more with the bonus of better readability!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Studio Clothing Collapsible menu</strong><br>
<!-- -->I knew this was bound to show up in my user testing as I had been struggling to implement it in Figma and put it on the back burner due to my issues in implementing an expandable and collapsible sidebar menu for all the clothing in their respective sections. This adds so much to the design as users can scroll through and see the potential of this feature rather than having a fixed menu only showing skirts. After trial and error with creating components and auto layout, I was able to accomplish this advanced functionality in Figma and have it fit in perfectly with the overall Studio page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Text on Home Page</strong><br>
<!-- -->I got lots of feedback on the readability of the home page and there were several directions I could go. I decided to add blurbs for each section to immediately key in users on what each section is intended to do and the overall narrative for the purpose of the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clickable Areas</strong><br>
<!-- -->This was another recurring concern I received especially as this is a mobile application. Rather than completely redesigning and reworking my interactions, I instead gave users more options and freedoms for clickable areas and different gestures so they can’t really mess up and the flow of the application wasn’t compromised.</p>
</li>
</ol>

&quot;The Design of Everday Things&quot;. These tie deeply into the concepts of signifiers
and affordances and are at the corner stone of guiding users easily on how to
use and navigate sites and designs they have no concept of in the past. These
constraints are vital to remember and leverage to faciliate a user experience that builds upon users existing knowledge base.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Represent a set of concepts from the reading in a concept map and describe the relationships." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/conceptmap">ConceptMap</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/inclusive-design-blog">Inclusive Design</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-31T14:30:00.000Z">October 31, 2024</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Inclusive Design Accessibility</p>
<p>&quot;Accessibility is to UI/UX design as a ramp is to a sidewalk&quot;</p>
<p>One of the core arguments supporting the need for accesibility is that while it isn&#x27;t just
the moral thing to do, it also benefits and uplifts all users of the web. Innovations like
closed captioning, larger text, readable and digestible pages, easy accesss to the main
content of a webpage, etc. all serve to empower the user experience on the web. While they are
primarily tabled with individuals from a range of disabilities, many people can benefit
and use these options without a thought to make their web surfing more smooth. This ties into the
analogy, as a lot of things we observe in our day to day that aim to help people with disabilities
also create ease in the places they&#x27;re implemented in. A sidewalk ramp is vital to those in wheelchairs
and also serves as a net positive for those riding in a bike, parents with strollers, and even just those
feeling a little tired after a long walk!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Write an analogy based on a topic in the reading and explain why the concept is important to remember in your career." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/approximateanalogy">ApproximateAnalogy</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/user-testing">User Testing Blog</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-25T14:30:00.000Z">October 25, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Do It Yourself Testing</p>
<p>In today&#x27;s blog entry I will be capturing the most important pieces in Chapter 9
of Steven Krug&#x27;s book revered design book &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Think&quot;. This chapter
expands on the key component of the desing life cycle: user testing. However Krug offers
a novel, cheaper, and more efficient approach to this practice through &quot;Do It Yourself
Testing&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Time Spent For Each Round of Testing</li>
</ol>
<p>One morning per month, this factors in conducting the tests, debriefing, and narrowing
down what fixes to tackle.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When do you test</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout the development process rather than when the project is almost done.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Number of testing rounds</li>
</ol>
<p>One per month is all that is nessecary as it it becomes a monthly routine!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Number of participants</li>
</ol>
<p>3 is more than enough to capture the most vital details</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>How do you choose particpants</li>
</ol>
<p>It is okay to not have the most segmented population to test. The frequency matters
more than the testers profile. It also is good to have prodcts as accessible as possible.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Where do you test</li>
</ol>
<p>On site or remote with observers in a seperate room using screen sharing to analyze.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Who should watch</li>
</ol>
<p>On site testing allows a wife variety of people working on the project to observe as well
as making it half a day only.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Reporting</li>
</ol>
<p>1-2 page email is enough to capture the team&#x27;s decisions during debriefing.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Who identifies issues?</li>
</ol>
<p>The development team should contribute to this role as well as key stakeholders who
ideally could meet over lunch to compare and contrast observations.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Primary Purpose</li>
</ol>
<p>Identify most common and fatal issues and commit to cleaning those up by the next
month for scheduled testing.</p>

<p>A couple hundred dollars or less per round of testing!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Write a tutorial on a task discussed in the reading, adding context for future reference." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/tutorial">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/user-testing-101">User Testing 101</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-25T14:30:00.000Z">October 25, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>User Testing 101</p>
<p>&quot;WHY&quot;</p>
<p>In chapter 5 of “Design of Everyday Things” Norman hones in on the devastation that poor design can create and as a result why it is key to be able to diagnose these problems before and as they come about. This leads to the word “why” and how this centers around this main issue Norman brings up. Root cause analysis is centered on the idea how determining what caused an error in someone’s actions. This is where the word “Why” comes into play as often when one wrong move is found the case is closed. This doesn’t account for the possibility of a butterfly effect of multiple decisions causing the issue and also emphasize the human error component to drastically. This is where the “Five Why’s” come into play. The 5 why’s is a Japanese concept developed by Sakichi Toyoda for the Toyota Production System division of the Toyota Motor Company. When searching for this root cause, keep asking “Why” and drill down as deep as possible to exhaust and flesh out the reason for a problematic behavior. The benefits and value of this method is the critical thinking facilitated in this process and pushing back against the tendency to stop finding potential errors once a human error is discovered. This has found mainstream use around a multitude of industries from business executives, UI designer, engineers and so much more.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Choose a section of the reading and summarize it in a single word.

<p>&quot;Seeing the big picture when creating mockups is to focusing the lens on a camera&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 2 of Presentation Zen hones in on the importance of drilling down to the big
picture of your design when in the planning stage. Some words of advice outlined in the book
is really sitting by yourself to reach that ideal big picture. It is important to have a clear, undistracted
mind to reach this state where problems and goals that may hinder this process appear. Another
key piece of advice is going &quot;analog&quot; and relying on pens, whiteboards, and papers for rough ideation
to further build the main idea of the design. This immediatly reminded me of the process of zooming
in when taking a picture using a camera. From the visual experience being the photographer to the actual
mechanics the camera goes too. At first you see the entire landscape of opporutnities but with the help
of guided direction and focus you can hone in on the subject and key component of the image with the help
of the lens. I see the lens as a blinder of other distractions like the advice mentioned above of being alone
and going analog. Only with giving up some focus and detail of the many other components, can one truly focus in
and capture that main idea.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Write an analogy based on a topic in the reading and explain why the concept is important to remember in your career." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/approximateanalogy">ApproximateAnalogy</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/feedback-blog">Feedback</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-16T14:30:00.000Z">October 16, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Guidance</p>
<p>I think the word &quot;Guidance&quot; is an impactful way to marry two very important components
within the framwork of feedback outlined in Kirkwoods article, &quot;How to give designers feedback they can actually use&quot;. These components would be &quot;reinforcing&quot; and &quot;redirecting&quot; feedback. Guidance encompasses these two terms far better than it would encompass &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; feedback Positive and negative are very black and white terms with no room for growth and interpretation that
guidance lives by. Through feedback following the ideals of guidance one can easily integrate
other best practices described in the article. For example, Kirkwood mentions that when giving redirecting feedback the ideal situation is a back and forth of clarifying and open ended questions where the team guides eachother to a solution rather than being told what exactly to do. This also
ties into one of the most vital parts of productive feedback which is fostering an environment of
ownership. Through guidance through both redirection and reinforcment the designer feels more agency
over their work as they were a central part of the feedback loop in this situations. When someone
is being talked at, it is easy to feel like a dispensible cog in the machine. This is so important for creative jobs like design as providing ones unique talents, experiences and perspectives is tantamount to the work experience, rather than just a set of hands who knows how to use a certain software.</p>

<p>Today I got inspired by Klaudia Simon and Ákos Izsák&#x27;s article &quot;23 Succesful
UX Portfolio Examples and a Guide for Creating Yours.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="riya portfolio sketch" src="/riya-ui-portfolio/assets/images/riya-ui-portfolio-sketch-85e0484bc580b37b4e4b103ec315f885.png" width="500" height="329" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This article gave a wealth of valuable information from concrete steps to follow to create a succesful UX portfolio to learning by example by presenting cutting edge examples. I decided to try out this advice and
ideas myself through a quick figma mockup of a potential frontpage of my
UI/UX portfolio. I was very inspired by the minimalistic, brutalist UI styles that masterfully use whitespace and sans serif text for a sleek,
modern approach. I personally throught the examples could use more contrast so I decided use my favorite shade of saturated purple to embue my personality and add a high contrast pop against an off white background. I also made the background an off white yellow hue to better complement the purple accents. I have always been a fan of retro, typewriter like fonts
with a modern approach so I used fonts that best embody that! Another personal spin I implemented was the organized chaos of different sized image displays that lack order but fit toegther in the expanse of white space. I made sure to follow the advice of the article of using the
same style mockups through royalty free ui images and also making sure they are front and center on my home page. I also added the key navigation mentioned like home, resume, and contacts.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Describe what inspired you and draw a quick sketch of an interface based on your reading." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/sketchinspo">SketchInspo</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/final-project-process">Final Project Process</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-15T14:30:00.000Z">October 15, 2024</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Design System</p>

follow the excercise from Brené browns
book <i> Dare to Lead </i>.</p>
<p>The first step of this excercise is to identify the values
that we initially connect with.This is indicated by all the values which have
been highlighted in the image. The values highlighted purple indicate the values
under the main value Achievment, the values highlighted green fall under
Groth, and the blue ones embody Belonging.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="1st step valuess" src="/riya-ui-portfolio/assets/images/1st-step-values-217d57d32890a4efe1854a91ed03e417.jpg" width="2244" height="2904" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>After this I drilled down even further on what two
overarching values encapsulate the initial group
of values I selected.I ended up with:</p>
<p>&quot;Authenticity&quot;: Achievement, Ambition, Initiative,
Personal Fulfillment, Belonging, Balance, Ethics
,Creativity, Curiosity, Humility, Independence,
Perseverance,Uniqueness</p>
<p>&quot;Legacy&quot;
Legacy,Pride,Recognition,Self-Expression, Loyalty, Learning, Inclusion,
Humor,Fun,Friendship,Fairness,Diversity,Dignity,Connection,Competence
,Making a Difference</p>
<p>Finally, I created two sentences to concisely communicate the
scope of these core two values and all the context from
other values to personalize it to my perspective.</p>
<p>Authenticity expresses the way I want to lead my decisions
and creative process in a manner that fully maximizes my abilities.</p>
<p>I value legacy in the sense  of the impact of my personhood on
those around me and in the value I am able to create or colloborate on
throughout time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">About Me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/about-me">About Me</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Projects</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/projects">Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/riya-ui-portfolio/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/your-org/my-ui-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 My UI Portfolio.
